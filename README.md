# HQ2 Analysis
This repository contains the analysis and documentation for determining the optimal location for a company's second headquarters (HQ2). The analysis is divided into two phases: preliminary and secondary.

## Preliminary Analysis

The preliminary analysis identifies potential states and cities based on customer accounts, employee count, customer satisfaction, partner accounts, use case count, revenue, average temperature, and proximity to the geographic center of the United States. A weighted average scoring model is used to rank the states and cities.

## Secondary Analysis

The secondary analysis delves deeper into the top cities identified in the preliminary analysis. It considers factors such as population, population growth, unemployment rate, median age, median house price, median income, cost of living, average commute time, and the number of colleges within a 60-mile radius. Data for this analysis is scraped from various websites using a Python script.

## Recommendations

The final recommendations for HQ2 locations are based on a combination of the preliminary and secondary analyses. The top recommended cities are listed in the documentation.
